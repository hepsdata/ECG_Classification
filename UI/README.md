# ECG Data Iris Spectrogram Visualization UI

This project provides a user interface for visualizing ECG data as iris spectrograms using Streamlit in Python. It utilizes algorithms for ECG signal processing and spectrogram generation to facilitate the analysis of ECG data.

## Features

- Load and visualize ECG data from CSV files.
- Preprocess ECG data with Pan-Tompkins algorithm.
- Generate and visualize Power Spectral Density (PSD) and Spectrogram (with and without log transform).
- Interpolate k-space data for improved visualization.
- 3D surface plot for k-space data visualization.
